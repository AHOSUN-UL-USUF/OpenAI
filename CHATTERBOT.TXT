I am a student at the University of Florida and I am interested in learning more about computer programming. I have some basic knowledge of HTML
and CSS, but I would like to learn more about other languages such as Python, Java, and C++. 
I am also interested in exploring new technologies such as machine learning, web development, and data science.

If you have any advice on how to get started with computer programming, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you!

I'm trying to find a way to use an external library in an AEM component.

I'm not sure if this is possible, but I'm hoping it is.

Thanks for your help!

Yes, it is possible to use an external library in an AEM component. You can include the library in the component's package, and then use it in 
the component's code. You can also use the library in the component's clientlibs, and then use it in the component's JavaScript code.
